- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoshGardner-208
- 👀 I’m interested in learing all the tools of the trade. Outside of school and work I enjoy spending time with my family and watching any sporting event I can find on television.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a wide variety of information about the software engineering field. I am enrolled at Colorado Techinical University and am expected to graduate in February of 2024.
- 💞️ I’m currently collborating with a fellow classmate and friend who has actively been working as a developer for the past six years, to create an app that will compile all the local holiday displays into a single application.
- 📫 You can best reach me by email.
